# If set, access to the ntfy server and API can be controlled on a granular level using

# Debian/RPM package users:
#   Use /var/lib/ntfy/user.db as user database to avoid permission issues. The package

# If enabled, clients can attach files to notifications as attachments. Minimum settings to enable attachments
# are "attachment-cache-dir" and "base-url".
#
# - attachment-cache-dir is the cache directory for attached files
# - attachment-total-size-limit is the limit of the on-disk attachment cache directory (total size)
# - attachment-file-size-limit is the per-file attachment size limit (e.g. 300k, 2M, 100M)
# - attachment-expiry-duration is the duration after which uploaded attachments will be deleted (e.g. 3h, 20h)

# If enabled, allow outgoing e-mail notifications via the 'X-Email' header. If this header is set,
# messages will additionally be sent out as e-mail using an external SMTP server. As of today, only
# SMTP servers with plain text auth and STARTLS are supported. Please also refer to the rate limiting settings
# below (visitor-email-limit-burst & visitor-email-limit-burst).
#
# - smtp-sender-addr is the hostname:port of the SMTP server
# - smtp-sender-user/smtp-sender-pass are the username and password of the SMTP user

# If enabled, ntfy will launch a lightweight SMTP server for incoming messages. Once configured, users can send
# emails to a topic e-mail address to publish messages to a topic.
#
# - smtp-server-listen defines the IP address and port the SMTP server will listen on, e.g. :25 or 1.2.3.4:25
# - smtp-server-domain is the e-mail domain, e.g. ntfy.sh
# - smtp-server-addr-prefix is an optional prefix for the e-mail addresses to prevent spam. If set to "ntfy-",
#   for instance, only e-mails to ntfy-$topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted. If this is not set, all emails to
#   $topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted (which may obviously be a spam problem).
